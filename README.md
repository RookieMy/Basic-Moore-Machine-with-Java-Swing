# Moore Machine Simulator (Java Swing)

A desktop application for designing and simulating Moore Machines, built with Java Swing.

Originally developed as a university project and later repackaged for demonstration and portfolio purposes.

## Why This Project?

This project demonstrates the implementation of finite state machine logic combined with a desktop user interface.

It highlights skills in:

- State-based system design
- Algorithmic thinking
- Java desktop development
- Software packaging


## Features

- Create finite state machines with up to 20 states
- Define custom alphabets and outputs
- Configure state transitions visually
- Simulate input strings
- Observe state progression and generated outputs
- Simple and interactive GUI
