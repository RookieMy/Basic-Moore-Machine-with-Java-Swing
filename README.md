# Moore Machine Simulator (Java Swing)

A desktop application for designing and simulating Moore Machines, built with Java Swing.

Originally developed as a university project and later repackaged for demonstration and portfolio purposes.

---

## Note
This project focuses on demonstrating finite state machine logic rather than production-level UI design.

## Features

- Create finite state machines with up to 20 states
- Define custom alphabets and outputs
- Configure state transitions visually
- Simulate input strings
- Observe state progression and generated outputs
- Simple and interactive GUI
